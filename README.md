# 🌑 Shadow Dimension

*“A dark evil has arrived in your hometown. A group of government scientists have opened a gate in their laboratory to another dimension called the Over Under. 
The Over Under is ruled by Navec (an evil creature of immense power) and his henchmen are called demons. The scientists thought they could control these creatures 
but alas, they failed and are being held captive in the Over Under. Navec has created sinkholes that will destroy the lab and is planning on eventually destroying 
your world.*

*The player’s name is Fae, the daughter of one of the scientists. In order to save your father and your town, you need to avoid the sinkholes, find the gate in the lab 
and defeat Navec & his demons in the Over Under. . . ”*
